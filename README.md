# ReturnSignOfProduct
Write a function solution that, given an array A of N intergers between (-100 and 100) of the product of all the numbers in the array multiplied together. Assume that N is between 1 and 1000.

For example:
  Given A = [1, -2, -3, 5], the function should return 1 (the multiplication equal 30)
  Given A = [1, -2, -3, 5], the function should return 1 (the multiplication equal -30)  
  Given A = [1, 2, 0, -5], the function should return 0 (the multiplication equal 0)
